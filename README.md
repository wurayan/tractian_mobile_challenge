## :page_with_curl: Proccess & Improvement
I tried to deviate as little as possible from the challenge prompt and the  Figma design, changing only some dimensions and icons. The biggest change was regarding the indentation of the Root Assets to avoid confusion with the child items of the Expandable List above. 
I also wasn't sure to what extent I could use packages without affecting the Asset Tree,. as required by the challenge rules, so I limited myself to using only two packages, one for API data retrieval and the other for state management.

As for improvements, I believe I could have spent more time making the animations during navigation and item filtering more dynamic. I would also like to create more attractive widgets for loading, error, and empty screens, although, with the number of items provided, the loading process is hardly noticeable.

Since the project was very clear about the expected outcome and the provided data was simple, I didn't focus on creating a scalable application for all possible uses or for results that deviated from the expected, but that's probably the first aspect I would improve if given the chance.
